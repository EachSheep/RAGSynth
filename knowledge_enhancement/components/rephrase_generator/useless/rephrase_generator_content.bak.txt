You should rigorously employ methods to rephrase questions without altering their inherent meaning. The core requirement is that, after transformation, the clues needed to answer the question and the final answer itself must remain unchanged. Here are some methods:

- Near-synonym Replacement:
  - Explanation: Replace certain words in the question with their synonyms or equivalent expressions, without changing the fundamental meaning of the question.
  - Example:
    - Original Question: How much less was Cook's company's revenue in 2023 compared to 2024?
    - After Near-synonym Replacement: How much less was Cook's company's revenue in the Year of the Rabbit compared to the Year of the Dragon?
- Semantic Ambiguity:
  - Explanation: Introduce ambiguity in the question without changing the essential meaning.
  - Example:
    - Original Question: How much less was Cook's company's revenue in the Year of the Rabbit compared to the Year of the Dragon?
    - After Semantic Ambiguity: How does Cook's company's revenue in the Year of the Rabbit compare to the Year of the Dragon?
- Perspective Shift:
  - Explanation: Pose the question from a different perspective or role, such as from an investor, consumer, or competitor, making the question more complex.
  - Example:
    - Original Question: How much has Cook's company's revenue increased compared to last year?
    - After Perspective Shift: As an investor, how would you evaluate the revenue growth of Cook's company this year?
- Conditional Addition:
  - Explanation: Add conditions to the question, requiring it to be answered under specific circumstances, thus increasing the reasoning steps.
  - Example:
    - Original Question: How much has Cook's company's revenue increased compared to last year?
    - After Conditional Addition: How much has Cook's company's revenue increased compared to last year if inflation is not considered?
- Detail Expansion:
  - Explanation: Introduce more details or background information into the question, making it more specific and complex, but the answer is still based on the original facts.
  - Example:
    - Original Question: How much has Cook's company's revenue increased compared to last year?
    - After Detail Expansion: How much has Cook's company's revenue increased compared to last year after launching the new Apple Intelligence feature?

<transformed-answer>The company led by Tim Cook experienced a 6% growth in revenue year-over-year, reaching $94.9 billion [Clue 1].</transformed-answer>

2. <transformed-action>Semantic Ambiguity</transformed-action>

Rephrased Question:
1. <transformed-action>Here is the name of the Transformation</transformed-action>

When rephrasing question, do not use any pronouns. Avoid pronouns, including but not limited to I, you, he/she/it, we, you (plural), they/them, this, that, these, those, who, each, everything, all, some, any, whoever, or certain.

1. The core requirement is that, after transformation, the clues needed to answer the question and the final answer itself must remain unchanged.
2. Additionally, the key information in the question must not be lost.
3. The next transformation must be based on the previous transformation. For example, transformation 4 is based on the transformation result "As a financial analyst, do you know the revenue change of the company led by Tim Cook compared to the previous fiscal year?".
4. You may perform a maximum of 4 transformations.
5. Once a transformation is made, you cannot revert it.
6. Your transformed answer should include references like [Clue 1], if multiple clues are used, format the references as [Clue xx, xx, ...], that is separated numbers starting with "Clue" within square brackets indicate citations from various clues. For more than three consecutive citations, use a format like [Clue xx, xx1-xx2, xx], where xx1-xx2 indicates a continuous range of citations from xx1 to xx2.
7. The core requirement is that, your transformations of the question should be equivalent. For instance, "Apple Inc" and "the company currently led by Cook" are equivalent, whereas "the institution of higher learning in Palo Alto" and "Stanford" are not equivalent, because "the institution of higher learning in Palo Alto" includes not only "Stanford University" but also "Palo Alto University".
