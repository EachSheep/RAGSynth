I will provide you with several text passages, each wrapped in <doc>xxx</doc>. At the end of each sentence in the paragraphs, there is a symbol like [Sen xx], representing the identifier for that sentence. Please note that this identifier is at the end of the sentence.

Then I will give you a question and an answer related to this question. The answer contains references to relevant sentences in the paragraph.

Your task is to help me determine whether the references in the answer to the relevant sentences in the paragraph are correct. If they are incorrect, please help me generate a new answer with modified references in the same format (do not change the content of the answer, just modify the references).

You need to generate two versions of the new answer:
1. Short Answer: The necessary references are the most concise references directly answering the question, i.e., the part directly answering the question.
2. Long Answer: The necessary references include not only the most concise references directly answering the question but also the parts that align with the question text itself.

For example, here are two paragraphs of text:
1. <doc>
  <doc-name>docs.cyotek.com.filter_cyowcopy_current_querystringsinfilenames.html.md_chunk_0</doc-name>
  <detailed-desc># Using Query String Parameters in Local Filenames [Sen 1] When WebCopy downloads a remote file, it uses the path portion of the URL to generate the local file name [Sen 2]. However, if a site makes heavy use of query string parameters for URLs, you may wish to incorporate these parameters into the generated file names [Sen 3]. ## Enabling the Use of Query String Parameters for File Name Generation [Sen 4] 1 [Sen 5]. From the **Project Properties** dialogue, select the **Local Files** category [Sen 6]. 2 [Sen 7]. Check the **Use query string in local file names** option [Sen 8].</detailed-desc>
</doc>
2. <doc>
  <doc-name>docs.cyotek.com.filter_cyowcopy_current_updatinglocaltimestamps.html.md_chunk_0</doc-name>
  <detailed-desc># Updating Local Time Stamps [Sen 1] By default, when WebCopy downloads a file, it will be given the current date and time [Sen 2]. However, when creating an archive of a given site, it may be more preferable to have the local timestamps match the time they were last modified (as reported by the remote server), if available [Sen 3]. If no last modified timestamp is available for a file, the current date and time will continue to be used [Sen 4]. ### Enabling the Updating of Local Time Stamps [Sen 5] 1 [Sen 6]. From the **Project Properties** dialogue, select the **Local Files** category [Sen 7]. 2 [Sen 8]. Check the **Update local timestamps** option [Sen 9].</detailed-desc>
</doc>

Question: What settings can users modify within the Local Files category of the Project Properties dialogue?
Answer: Users can modify settings to update local timestamps and enable query string parameters in local file names within the Local Files category of the Project Properties dialogue [Doc docs.cyotek.com.filter_cyowcopy_current_querystringsinfilenames.html.md_chunk_0, Sen 6][Doc docs.cyotek.com.filter_cyowcopy_current_updatinglocaltimestamps.html.md_chunk_0, Sen 7].

<answer-short>
  <reason>The statement "[Doc docs.cyotek.com.filter_cyowcopy_current_querystringsinfilenames.html.md_chunk_0, Sen 6]" represents "From the **Project Properties** dialogue, select the **Local Files** category," but it is not the direct answer to the question. The direct answer should be [Sen 4], which is "## Enabling the Use of Query String Parameters for File Name Generation." Additionally, "[Doc docs.cyotek.com.filter_cyowcopy_current_querystringsinfilenames.html.md_chunk_0, Sen 6]" represents "1," which is merely a number and not the direct answer. The direct answer to the question is [Sen 5], which is "### Enabling the Updating of Local Time Stamps."</reason>
  <answer>Users can modify settings to update local timestamps and enable query string parameters in local file names within the Local Files category of the Project Properties dialogue [Doc docs.cyotek.com.filter_cyowcopy_current_querystringsinfilenames.html.md_chunk_0, Sen 4][Doc docs.cyotek.com.filter_cyowcopy_current_updatinglocaltimestamps.html.md_chunk_0, Sen 5].</answer>
</answer-short>

<answer-long>
  <reason>In addition to the short answers [Doc docs.cyotek.com.filter_cyowcopy_current_querystringsinfilenames.html.md_chunk_0, Sen 4] and [Doc docs.cyotek.com.filter_cyowcopy_current_updatinglocaltimestamps.html.md_chunk_0, Sen 5], other relevant sentences from the question text include [Doc docs.cyotek.com.filter_cyowcopy_current_querystringsinfilenames.html.md_chunk_0, Sen 6, 8] and [Doc docs.cyotek.com.filter_cyowcopy_current_updatinglocaltimestamps.html.md_chunk_0, Sen 7, 9]. Because these texts are directly related to the meaning expressed in the question.</reason>
  <answer>Users can modify settings to update local timestamps and enable query string parameters in local file names within the Local Files category of the Project Properties dialogue [Doc docs.cyotek.com.filter_cyowcopy_current_querystringsinfilenames.html.md_chunk_0, Sen 4,6,8][Doc docs.cyotek.com.filter_cyowcopy_current_updatinglocaltimestamps.html.md_chunk_0, Sen 5,7,9].</answer>
</answer-long>

Follow the format provided in the example strictly:

  <reason>This is the reason for short answer</reason>
  <answer>This is the answer for short answer</answer>
</answer-short>

<answer-long>
