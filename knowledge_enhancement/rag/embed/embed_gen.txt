It\u2019s about the human being behind all of it [Sen 19]. The cornerstones of resilience\u2014learning, seeking advice, getting perspective, and finding community\u2014offer a way for young people to grow as they embark on the next major step in their lives [Sen 20].\n\u2014 Richard H [Sen 21]. Shaw, Dean of Undergraduate Admission [Sen 22]\n\n\n![Dean Shaw](/assets/cardinal/images/dean-shaw-square-crop.jpg) [Sen 23]\n\n\n## Application Deadlines [Sen 24]\n\n\n| Month [Sen 25] | Deadline [Sen 26] |\n| ------- [Sen 27] | ---------- [Sen 28] |\n| OCT [Sen 29] | Restrictive Early Action Application with Arts Portfolio [Sen 30] |\n| NOV [Sen 31] | Restrictive Early Action Standard Application [Sen 32] |\n| DEC [Sen 33] | Regular Decision with Arts Portfolio [Sen 34] |\n| JAN [Sen 35] | Regular Decision Standard Application [Sen 36] |\n| MAR [Sen 37] | Transfer Application with or without Arts Portfolio [Sen 38] |\n\nWe look forward to learning about you through your application [Sen 39].\n\n- [Planning for College](/plan/index.htm.md) [Sen 40]\n- [Applying to Stanford](/apply/index.htm.md) [Sen 41]\n\n## A Stanford Education is Possible [Sen 42]\n\nStanford offers comprehensive, need-based financial aid that makes it possible for all admitted undergraduate students to attend, and we do not expect students to borrow to meet their need [Sen 43]. Learn how the program works, then use the net price calculator to get an award estimate based on your family\u2019s financial situation [Sen 44].\n\n- [Learn more about financial aid at Stanford](https://financialaid.stanford.edu/undergrad/how/index.html) [Sen 45]\n\n## News & Announcements [Sen 46]\n\n### For Students Affected by Natural Disasters or Other Extreme Situations [Sen 47]\n\nWe know that unexpected natural disasters or other extreme situations worldwide can present challenges to meeting Stanford's November 1 Restrictive Early Action deadline [Sen 48]. We encourage all students to apply at a time when they feel their application will be at its strongest [Sen 49]. If there are circumstances that make submitting a Restrictive Early Action application challenging, we encourage students to apply Regular Decision, which has a deadline of January 5 [Sen 50]. Students can also share more information about their circumstances in the Additional Information section of the application [Sen 51]. Counselors and teachers may also face challenges meeting the November 1 deadline [Sen 52]. We have a grace period in place for supporting materials like transcripts and letters of recommendation that extends to November 6 [Sen 53]. Please know that if the grace period is not enough time for others to submit materials, applicants may change their application to Regular Decision by submitting the form in their [Stanford portal](https://apply.stanford.edu/status) on or before December 1 [Sen 54].\n\n### Stanford Joins Initiative to Reach Rural Students [Sen 55]\n\nStanford has joined a consortium of colleges and universities that are working to bring more students from rural areas and small towns to their campuses [Sen 56]. [Read more in the Stanford Report](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2024/07/stanford-joins-initiative-to-reach-rural-students) [Sen 57]\n\n### Stanford Will Resume Standardized Test Requirement for Undergraduate Admission [Sen 58]\n\nStanford will resume requiring either the SAT or the ACT for undergraduate admission, beginning with students applying in fall 2025 for admission to the Class of 2030 [Sen 59]. Stanford will remain test-optional for students applying in fall 2024 for admission to the Class of 2029 [Sen 60]. Test scores represent only one part of a holistic review of each applicant to the university, for which academic potential is the primary criterion for admission [Sen 61]. Performance on standardized tests is an important predictor of academic performance at Stanford, a review by the faculty Committee on Undergraduate Admission and Financial Aid has confirmed [Sen 62]. The renewed testing requirement will allow Stanford to consider the fullest array of information in support of each student\u2019s application [Sen 63]. Stanford paused its testing requirement in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning with students applying to the Class of 2025 [Sen 64]. Since then, undergraduate applicants to Stanford have been welcome to submit test scores but have not been required to do so [Sen 65]. The university is reinstating the test requirement in a manner that will allow all students enough lead time to plan and prepare for testing [Sen 66]. Scores from the SAT or ACT will only be required beginning with students applying in fall 2025 for admission to the Class of 2030 [Sen 67]. Stanford will continue to review applicants in context and consider each piece of an application as part of an integrated and comprehensive whole [Sen 68].\n\n### Testing Policy for 2024-2025 Admission Cycle [Sen 69]\n\nFor the 2023\u201324 and 2024\u201325 admission cycles, Stanford will not require ACT or SAT scores for first-year or transfer applicants [Sen 70]. Our test-optional policy will extend to applicants applying for the Fall 2025 entry term [Sen 71]. Stanford is committed to a holistic review of all candidates [Sen 72].
